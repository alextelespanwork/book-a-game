This means if `func` makes AJAX request, that request\r\n     * will be made every time someone subscribes to resulting Observable, but not before.\r\n     *\r\n     * Optionally, selector function can be passed to `bindObservable`.

By default subscription to Observable calls `func`\r\n     * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as last parameter will defer call to input function,\r\n     * just like wrapping that call in `setTimeout` with time `0` would. So if you use async Scheduler\r\n     * and call `subscribe` on output Observable, all function calls that are currently executing,\r\n     * will end before `func` is invoked.\r\n     *\r\n     * When it comes to emitting results passed to callback, by default they are emitted\r\n     * immediately after `func` invokes callback. In particular, if callback is called synchronously,\r\n     * then subscription to resulting Observable will call `next` function synchronously as well.\r\n     * If you want to defer that call, using `Scheduler.async` will, again, do the job.\r\n     * This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can, in a sense, ensure that `func`\r\n     * always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\r\n     *\r\n     * Note that Observable created by output function will always emit only one value\r\n     * and then complete right after. Even if `func` calls callback multiple times, values from\r\n     * second and following calls will never appear in the stream. If you need to\r\n     * listen for multiple calls, you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or\r\n     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\r\n     *\r\n     * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property), that context will be set\r\n     * to the same context that output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`\r\n     * is called as method of some object, in order to preserve proper behaviour,\r\n     * it is recommended to set context of output function to that object as well,\r\n     * provided `func` is not already bound.\r\n     *\r\n     * If input function calls its callback in \"node style\" (i.e. first argument to callback is\r\n     * optional error parameter signaling whether call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}\r\n     * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.\r\n     * `bindCallback` will treat such functions without any difference and error parameter\r\n     * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.\r\n     *\r\n     *\r\n     * @example <caption>Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API</caption>\r\n     * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)\r\n     * var getJSONAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);\r\n     * var result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');\r\n     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\r\n     *\r\n     *\r\n     * @example <caption>Receive array of arguments passed to callback</caption>\r\n     * someFunction((a, b, c) => {\r\n     *   console.log(a);

On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\r\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\r\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\r\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\r\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\r\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\r\n * value.\r\n *\r\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\r\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\r\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\r\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\r\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\r\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\r\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\r\n *\r\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\r\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\r\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\r\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\r\n * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\r\n * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>\r\n * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now\r\n * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now\r\n * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);\r\n * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\r\n * // Logs\r\n * // [0, 0] after 0.5s\r\n * // [1, 0] after 1s\r\n * // [1, 1] after 1.5s\r\n * // [2, 1] after 2s\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>\r\n * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(\r\n *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds\r\n * );\r\n * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);\r\n * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\r\n * // Logs\r\n * // [0, 0, 0] immediately\r\n * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s\r\n * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s\r\n * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * @example <caption>Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index</caption>\r\n * var weight = Rx.Observable.of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);\r\n * var height = Rx.Observable.of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);\r\n * var bmi = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(weight, height, (w, h) => w / (h * h));\r\n * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));\r\n *\r\n * // With output to console:\r\n * // BMI is 24.212293388429753\r\n * // BMI is 23.93948099205209\r\n * // BMI is 23.671253629592222\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * @see {@link combineAll}\r\n * @see {@link merge}\r\n * @see {@link withLatestFrom}\r\n *\r\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable1 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\r\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable2 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\r\n * More than one input Observables may be given as arguments\r\n * or an array of Observables may be given as the first argument.\r\n * @param {function} [project] An optional function to project the values from\r\n * the combined latest values into a new value on the output Observable.\r\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=null] The IScheduler to use for subscribing to\r\n * each input Observable.\r\n * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\r\n * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\r\n * each input Observable.\r\n * @static true\r\n * @name combineLatest\r\n * @owner Observable\r\n */\r\nfunction combineLatest() {\r\n    var observables = [];\r\n    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\r\n        observables[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\r\n    }\r\n    var project = null;\r\n    var scheduler = null;\r\n    if (isScheduler_1.isScheduler(observables[observables.length - 1])) {\r\n        scheduler = observables.pop();\r\n    }\r\n    if (typeof observables[observables.length - 1] === 'function') {\r\n        project = observables.pop();\r\n    }\r\n    // if the first and only other argument besides the resultSelector is an array\r\n    // assume it's been called with `combineLatest([obs1, obs2, obs3], project)`\r\n    if (observables.length === 1 && isArray_1.isArray(observables[0])) {\r\n        observables = observables[0];\r\n    }\r\n    return new ArrayObservable_1.ArrayObservable(observables, scheduler).lift(new combineLatest_1.CombineLatestOperator(project));\r\n}\r\nexports.combineLatest = combineLatest;\r\n//# sourceMappingURL=combineLatest.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/combineLatest.js\n// module id = 845\n// module chunks = 0 1","\"use strict\";\r\nvar concat_1 = require('../operator/concat');\r\nexports.concat = concat_1.concatStatic;\r\n//# sourceMappingURL=concat.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/concat.js\n// module id = 846\n// module chunks = 0 1","\"use strict\";\r\nvar DeferObservable_1 = require('./DeferObservable');\r\nexports.defer = DeferObservable_1.DeferObservable.create;\r\n//# sourceMappingURL=defer.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/defer.js\n// module id = 847\n// module chunks = 0 1","\"use strict\";\r\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\r\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\r\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\r\n    d.prototype = b === null ?
